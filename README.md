# Posts managing web application

Technologies: TypeScript, MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS, Angular Material

I created this web application as a personal project to test my knowledge in MEAN stack.
App is designed to manage posts with title, content and image. Not registered users can see posts from other users but they must register to be able to create, edit or delete own posts. 
Posts are stored in nosql database, MongoDB.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
